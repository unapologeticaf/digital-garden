I'm Gabriele, also known as [[unapologeticaf|unapologetic.af]], [[flygohr|Flygohr]], Liar, or [[stray_scribbles|Stray]] online. this is my littleÂ [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought#what-is-digital-gardening).

I'm currently:
- writing short poems for my book [[tags/stray|stray (poetry book)]]. looking to get it printed out this year
- making one drawing a day for my [[stray_scribbles]] Instagram page (and working through [[Inktober 2024]] in the process)
- designing a [[Liar Tarots|tarot deck]] featuring my OC [[Liar]]. I'm also writing and illustrating his [[Liar's story (comic)|lore]]
- working full time as a digital fantasy artist under the art name [[flygohr|Flygohr]]
- preparing to become a tattoo artist. next step: pass the sanitary and hygiene exam required for tattoo and piercing practitioners
- preparing a [[Cairn]] tabletop RPG campaign for my group of friends
- I would also like to create [my childhood RPG](https://github.com/unapologeticaf/childhood-rpg), the project is currently on hiatus but downloadable from [my GitHub page](https://github.com/unapologeticaf/). I might open this up for collabs in the future

I'm also:
- reading [[The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe]] and [[Limonov]]
- I'm re-reading [[Fullmetal Alchemist]], and playing catch-up with [[One Piece]] (currently on chapter 1127)
- binge re-watching the YT channel [[vSauce]], but also diving deep in the essays of [[Horses]] and [[BobbyBroccoli]]
- re-installing [[League of Legends]], see how long it last before I tilt myself out of this planet
