I'm Gabriele, also known as [[flygohr]], Burzak, [[stray.scribbles]], or Aldebaran1317 online. this is my little [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought#what-is-digital-gardening).

I'm currently:
- writing short poems for my book [[tags/stray|stray (poetry book)]]
- making one drawing a day for my [[stray.scribbles]] Instagram page
- working full time as a digital fantasy artist under the art name [[flygohr|Flygohr]]
- reading [[The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe]], [[Fullmetal Alchemist]] (re-reading, actually), [[One Piece]] (currently on chapter 1122), and [[Altered Carbon]]'s second book, [[Broken Angels]]
- binge watching the YT channels [[Horses]] and [[Answers in Progress]]
- playing [[Solasta CotM]] and [[Pokémon TCG Live]]
- creating a one-shot campaign for me and my flatmates using the [[Cairn]] system

I would also like to create [my childhood RPG](https://github.com/unapologeticaf/childhood-rpg), the project is currently on hiatus but downloadable from [my GitHub page](https://github.com/unapologeticaf/).
