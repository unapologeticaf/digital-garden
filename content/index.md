I'm Gabriele, also known as [[unapologeticaf|unapologetic.af]], [[flygohr|Flygohr]], Liar, or [[stray_scribbles|Stray]] online. this is my littleÂ [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought#what-is-digital-gardening).

I'm currently:
- writing short poems for my book [[tags/stray|stray (poetry book)]]. looking to get it printed out this year
- making one drawing a day for my [[stray_scribbles]] Instagram page (and working through [[Inktober 2024]] in the process)
- designing a [[Liar Tarots|tarot deck]] featuring my OC [[Liar]]. I'm also writing and illustrating his [[Liar's story (comic)|lore]], but I'm finally focusing on setting up the printable files for the cards
- working full time as a digital fantasy artist under the art name [[flygohr|Flygohr]]
- writing articles for [my small Substack publication](https://flygohr.substack.com/) as [[flygohr|Flygohr]]
- preparing to become a tattoo artist. next step: pass the sanitary and hygiene exam required for tattoo and piercing practitioners
- playing a lot of the tabletop game [[Nemesis]], it's been very fun with my gf and flatmates
- I would also like to create [my childhood RPG](https://github.com/unapologeticaf/childhood-rpg), the project is currently on hiatus but downloadable from [my GitHub page](https://github.com/unapologeticaf/). I might open this up for collabs in the future

I'm also:
- putting on hold the [[The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe]] and focusing on reading marketing related books. This week it's the turn of [[Building a StoryBrand]] by Donald Miller. oh, I'm still reading [[Limonov]] as well for fun
- re-reading [[Fullmetal Alchemist]], and playing catch-up with [[One Piece]] (currently on chapter 1130)
- binge re-watching the YT channel [[vSauce]], but also diving deep in the essays of [[Horses]] and [[BobbyBroccoli]]. to be fair, I've also flooded my YT feed with retrospectives on old game series and watching 3h+ vids while working or drawing
- playing some [[Wild Rift]] after getting tired of [[League of Legends]]
- on a 600+ days streak on Duolingo lmao

collections:
- [[tags/read|books I've read]]
