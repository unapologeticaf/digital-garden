#### Off ✅

You stagger, under the pouring rain. One eye half closed, swollen. Enough to hold back the tears.
Holding a bottle with one hand. With the other, you push your wet, long hair away from your face.
A cigarette, now dead, slips from your broken lip. The wind is getting stronger. So much, that you need to plant your feet. Firmly.
This wind, it’s sticking your cold clothes to your bones.

As if you’d care.

You ask yourself,
how is this possible. 


How could you end up like this, right here.


Below you the sea is boiling, homicidal. One wind gust makes you slip, badly. Your elbow. The bottle you are holding, shatters. Your ankle just bents, innaturally. 
And instead of screaming in pain, you remain still, staring at the black waves.
With that look. With that grin.


And you, slowly, get back up.


You ask yourself,
How is this possible. How are you still standing.


It’s just nothing. Salt water and wine mix with your cuts. But you, you don’t feel them. And what can one fall be, after a life spent plummeting. What can some stormy sea be, when you know what it’s like to drown.
Time slows down. You recall all the humiliations, the pain, the hardship. Your hard work. Your sacrifices, your sleepless nights. The blood, the sweat, the tears.


You ask yourself,
How is this possible. How the fuck you didn’t just kill yourself yet.


You suddenly go blind. You hear no sounds. An electrostatic blanket covers every inch of your skin. Your pupils are like needles. A stroke of light, striking the ground just a few feet away from you.
A hollow roar begins to make its way into your ringing ears.
And as you regain your sight,
you wonder.


How is this possible.


I mean, you are still here. With your successes, your goals. Your mission. 
Nothing broke you. Nothing sank you. 
You managed to make up a life from nothing. 
You already know it, that you’ll get ahead of everyone.
This is a war and you, you are a warrior. A silhouette, standing against a lightning storm. 
A bolt of pure energy, so much you can’t even contain it. 
Maybe, just maybe, you actually have an answer.


Maybe,
just maybe, there’s no storm that can take you away.

Fade
I could’ve done things in many different ways.
I had many choices, I picked my own path.
This is my way, yet


I feel so different.
It’s not like I don’t belong,
but more as if I wasn’t even ever here.


I know you see ghosts, too.


I see them all the time,
all at the same time.
I see things that once were, and now aren’t.
Stuff that could've been there,
or that will never be.


Rolling in front of my eyes,
as I walk away.


Thanks for everything,
but I won’t ever look back.
And you won’t hear me leaving,
because I was never there.

Hearts
I, the void
In me it still echoes
Your resounding failure


Me and you, the hearts at the end of the world
The hearts without end
Justified by sacrifices
Confronted by a mind
Now sick, poisoned,
Conscious of this
Lie


I, hiding behind a pale face
Where death is alive
The only place I know
Where every truth
Is just a new mask for
Us


And if this
Void where what we did
Dies
We get no burial
Nothing, for anybody
Not even for you


It wakes us up
Screaming in pain
From that slaughterhouse
Of your brain
We just bleed monsters
And here, the monster
Is me


Try to forget me
Forget my name, my face
This is what happens
When we try to fix things
So try, not to listen
To me


Ignoring my voice
Has never been so easy
Yet, you have my grin 
Sewn onto your lips


Me and you, the hearts at the end of the world
The hearts without end
Blinded by the marvels
Sitting at your feet

Circles ✅
The sky is grey, empty, cold.
Its sunset throws metallic reflections
on that desert you hold inside.


Your empty thoughts,
your insomniac abortions,
gutted outside starless nights.
Hiding behind your steel there’s
obsidian, and never ending days.


It’s raining blood now.
It hammers your head,
it rips your heart,
leaves you breathless.


You barely remember the snow
from that picture, the one you couldn’t understand.
You are wonderful, while you licki your own wounds.
While crying salt all over them.


Doesn’t matter, you whisper.
Without hate.
And you almost, almost throw up.


The air is thick with iron.
A fragile, porcelain dawn
shines from behind your walls.
And almost, almost
makes your hell disappear


Your eyes are wide open,
shining through your dirty hair.
Flies are trying to eat them.
Dark circles are trying to dig them out.
You almost, almost


can’t see anymore.

Meds
Darling
Darling, save your breath
You know, it’s not ending now
Not soon, anyways
I’m not falling
I’m not bowing
As if I was capable


Darling, you’d like to know my plans
If only I had some
If only I could, share them


I’m just selfish
A parasitic asshole
Darling, I’m that unkept promise


Like us, finding
Justification in songs
I know you are too kind
To tell me to fuck off


Darling, your old photos are on fire
With your innocence
Why, why do you always want to go
Why, why you never stay


I feel the burn, paper squeaking
Under this lead sky
If only I could


Maybe you realized already
That there’s always just one word missing
I ain’t made for love
So try to steal that from me
Read between the lines


Darling, I’m going to catch your breath
I’m just waiting for my turn
To slip inside, break your walls


Darling, 
Did you take your meds?
