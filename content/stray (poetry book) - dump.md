#### Clouds ✅
---
Your thoughts are thickening, like clouds. Now melting away in the cold, snowflakes of sorrow.
You are gasping for air, struggling to stay afloat in an ocean of black oil. The pitch black waves are clinging onto you, won’t leave you.

What if I set the sea on fire? 

Your dreams are like rain, slipping through your fingers.
As if you ever had the courage to chase them.
And you watch them plummeting, from the heights of your crimson sky.
Ready to shatter to the ground.
You know, one of us is definitely wrong.
I extend my hand.

What if I was holding a knife in the other one?

Your desire is burning, consuming you from the inside.
Your willpower is like poison ivy, it’s infecting everything inside you.
Opening cracks in that wall, in that armor you carry like a shield.
Maybe it will break.
You should jump anyway.
It’s soft. I’ll catch you.

What if I step away at the last second?

Your days are gone, way before you even started living them.
You’ve become an hostage, spared by your own anxiety.
You’d just want to disappear. Go anywhere, but here.
And I say, please catch that train. Run away.

When you’ll come back, I’ll be here.

And what if I don’t wait for you?

#### Prometheus
---
This is for you.
For you, that refuse to be a slave.
Never bending,
beaten, chained,
jailed and
it’s not like you are going to break.

This is for you, fire thief.
As you are a warning.
You being dead, or alive.
Good, or bad.
It doesn’t matter,
as long as you keep fighting.
As if we were at war.

This rain,
shattering onto the battlefield.
Stripping it of every hope,
washing away your blood.

It fascinates you.
As Icarus.
You want to know where everything comes from and then,
wings made of wax melting.
It’s you, shattering to the ground now.

Life gives, and deaths takes it away.
Let her practice more.

This is for you,
victim of your own self.
You and your boots, your shoes, your reason to live.
Dirty, ragged, torn.
You chase people, without ever being able
to catch them.
Boredom to run after you,
deep, dark, macabre.
It’s the tedium, understood only by
who knows that the crown is just
someone’s own sacrifice.

Like ashes, that slowly spiral down,
breaking into coffee stains.
Into tears, rolling down your cheeks,
to your soft lips.
They welcome the salt.
You twitch them, grimacing.

In the end, your wings will not be made of wax.
Not that one time.
And then, you’ll close your eyes.
You’ll hold your breath,
and you’ll jump.

#### Off ✅
---
You stagger, under the pouring rain. One eye half closed, swollen. Enough to hold back the tears.
Holding a bottle with one hand. With the other, you push your wet, long hair away from your face.
A cigarette, now dead, slips from your broken lip. The wind is getting stronger. So much, that you need to plant your feet. Firmly.
This wind, it’s sticking your cold clothes to your bones.

As if you’d care.

You ask yourself,
how is this possible. 


How could you end up like this, right here.


Below you the sea is boiling, homicidal. One wind gust makes you slip, badly. Your elbow. The bottle you are holding, shatters. Your ankle just bents, innaturally. 
And instead of screaming in pain, you remain still, staring at the black waves.
With that look. With that grin.


And you, slowly, get back up.


You ask yourself,
How is this possible. How are you still standing.


It’s just nothing. Salt water and wine mix with your cuts. But you, you don’t feel them. And what can one fall be, after a life spent plummeting. What can some stormy sea be, when you know what it’s like to drown.
Time slows down. You recall all the humiliations, the pain, the hardship. Your hard work. Your sacrifices, your sleepless nights. The blood, the sweat, the tears.


You ask yourself,
How is this possible. How the fuck you didn’t just kill yourself yet.


You suddenly go blind. You hear no sounds. An electrostatic blanket covers every inch of your skin. Your pupils are like needles. A stroke of light, striking the ground just a few feet away from you.
A hollow roar begins to make its way into your ringing ears.
And as you regain your sight,
you wonder.


How is this possible.


I mean, you are still here. With your successes, your goals. Your mission. 
Nothing broke you. Nothing sank you. 
You managed to make up a life from nothing. 
You already know it, that you’ll get ahead of everyone.
This is a war and you, you are a warrior. A silhouette, standing against a lightning storm. 
A bolt of pure energy, so much you can’t even contain it. 
Maybe, just maybe, you actually have an answer.


Maybe,
just maybe, there’s no storm that can take you away.

Quore[1] ✅
I thought I had the world in the palm of my hand.
I thought I was ready, I thought I had a plan.
I thought I was never going to lose myself,
until I found myself in that stare of yours.


I had been writing and drawing about you long before I met you.
You had that something.
That something you always hide, except with me.


I’m sitting at the window, looking at the snowy rain just outside.
I’m crippling my thoughts in this room too small for my dreams.
I wrap myself in a blanket, taking one last drag from this cig.
I shiver, I thought I was never going to give up.


We were just kids.
I had nothing to give you.
I couldn’t give you any stability, any sustain.
I didn’t have any certainty.
I couldn’t save you.
I couldn’t take on any of my promises.
Yet, you stayed, even if it was just for a little while.
Yet, it couldn’t have ended differently.


Now I have grown.
I have changed, so much you probably woudln’t even recognize me.
I thought you would have missed me, that you would’ve come back to me.
That you’d remember me, that you’d find your way to me.


Doesn’t really matter anymore.
I am, and I always will be, selfish.
This won’t change, and you did the right thing.
I should’ve never looked in those damn green eyes.
I should’ve never gifted you those keys, the ones to my heart.


Now, I can finally stand on my own.
Now that I could finally give back everything I stole from you,
now that I have been working on myself,
working on everything I was missing.


Now, I miss you.
________________
Fade
I could’ve done things in many different ways.
I had many choices, I picked my own path.
This is my way, yet


I feel so different.
It’s not like I don’t belong,
but more as if I wasn’t even ever here.


I know you see ghosts, too.


I see them all the time,
all at the same time.
I see things that once were, and now aren’t.
Stuff that could've been there,
or that will never be.


Rolling in front of my eyes,
as I walk away.


Thanks for everything,
but I won’t ever look back.
And you won’t hear me leaving,
because I was never there.

#### dream ✅
---
I’ve spent so many nights walking through sleeping cities
I seldom slept, watching freight trains pass by
I spent so much time alone, in the dark, that darkness is a part of me now
sometimes, I don’t even know if I’m awake
maybe that’s why
my nightmares feel so real

the light is overrated
as if I had a path I needed to follow
and when I turn it off, I can finally stop seeing the shadows

I now can’t tell days from nights
maybe because monsters look the same in both
maybe, I can’t tell the monsters apart
from me
sometimes, I don’t even know if I’m awake
maybe, it’s because the night sky has been
my home, my roof, for so long now

who cares?
I don’t need a home, anyways
who cares if I lost my light, I’m going to shine through anyways
sometimes, I don’t even know if I’m awake

maybe, it’s because
I made of dreams
my way of life

you know that feeling

you’ve met so many people, and yet you know nothing about yourself
you are barely looking at your own life, wasting it away
nobody is going to make a movie on that shit
nobody is going to read your story, if you don’t start writing it yourself

you know that feeling
of your days shortening, your hours disappearing
the fleeting nature of time, like sand slipping through your fingers

like sand, your walls break down, crumbling
your precious facade, shattering to the ground
that feeling

here I am, hiding in between the lines
like sand, running in the wind past the car window

now that nothing is changing
I’ll change skin
I’ll change homes
I’ll change countries

now that nothing is changing

I’ll change you
________________
Hearts
I, the void
In me it still echoes
Your resounding failure


Me and you, the hearts at the end of the world
The hearts without end
Justified by sacrifices
Confronted by a mind
Now sick, poisoned,
Conscious of this
Lie


I, hiding behind a pale face
Where death is alive
The only place I know
Where every truth
Is just a new mask for
Us


And if this
Void where what we did
Dies
We get no burial
Nothing, for anybody
Not even for you


It wakes us up
Screaming in pain
From that slaughterhouse
Of your brain
We just bleed monsters
And here, the monster
Is me


Try to forget me
Forget my name, my face
This is what happens
When we try to fix things
So try, not to listen
To me


Ignoring my voice
Has never been so easy
Yet, you have my grin 
Sewn onto your lips


Me and you, the hearts at the end of the world
The hearts without end
Blinded by the marvels
Sitting at your feet

#### Stuff I never told you
---
I once wanted to surprise you by showing up at your place to cheer you up, but turned the car back halfway, when you told me you just wanted to be alone.
There's a chat on Telegram with a roleplaying adventure I had ready for you.
I love you.
I made a drawing of us together.
I was yours even before we first met.
When you didn't text me that morning, I knew it was over.
I kept upvoting all your posts.



Circles ✅
The sky is grey, empty, cold.
Its sunset throws metallic reflections
on that desert you hold inside.


Your empty thoughts,
your insomniac abortions,
gutted outside starless nights.
Hiding behind your steel there’s
obsidian, and never ending days.


It’s raining blood now.
It hammers your head,
it rips your heart,
leaves you breathless.


You barely remember the snow
from that picture, the one you couldn’t understand.
You are wonderful, while you licki your own wounds.
While crying salt all over them.


Doesn’t matter, you whisper.
Without hate.
And you almost, almost throw up.


The air is thick with iron.
A fragile, porcelain dawn
shines from behind your walls.
And almost, almost
makes your hell disappear


Your eyes are wide open,
shining through your dirty hair.
Flies are trying to eat them.
Dark circles are trying to dig them out.
You almost, almost


can’t see anymore.

Superficial
You think you are holding
The knife by the handle
You wear your mask
To your usual recital


But this time, nobody is clapping
Oh, you are fucked
Nobody knows you
Nobody calls you home


As if you were scared
As if you gave up

Refuse

Darling
Darling, save your breath
You know, it’s not ending now
Not soon, anyways
I’m not falling
I’m not bowing
As if I was capable


Darling, you’d like to know my plans
If only I had some
If only I could, share them


I’m just selfish
A parasitic asshole
Darling, I’m that unkept promise


Like us, finding
Justification in songs
I know you are too kind
To tell me to fuck off


Darling, your old photos are on fire
With your innocence
Why, why do you always want to go
Why, why you never stay


I feel the burn, paper squeaking
Under this lead sky
If only I could


Maybe you realized already
That there’s always just one word missing
I ain’t made for love
So try to steal that from me
Read between the lines


Darling, I’m going to catch your breath
I’m just waiting for my turn
To slip inside, break your walls


Darling, 
Did you take your meds?

Dusk

Naive
It’s like pulling a trigger
In the name of love
Black figures, black robes
I welcome you


It’s blood, following you
Poisoned waters, everywhere
Be, seek,
What could you become?


If only you could understand
Without passion
Without determination
It’s just self destruction


I, bleak corpse
I welcome you

Drop
Pressure dropping, tension rising
Jumping into an empty darkness
You feel like passing out
At the bottom of things
We are just dust
Shaped by the wind
Ever changing
Yet never
________________
Again
Here we go again. It’s cold outside, that cold you won’t ever stop loving. The clanging thunders almost cover the sound of your thoughts. Heavy rain starts shattering your hopes for the day. You look past the foggy window, the creaking of the fire seems so distant, as if it wasn’t in the next room.


As if those weren’t all the words you ever wrote, the ones burning with rage. You made your own hell. As if paradise was everything you wanted to live for. I mean, it’s your choice, to stay locked up, in your castle, oh, my queen.


It’s your responsibility, to love what you have. Your responsibility, to change what you don’t love. Never settle.
Feel the rain knocking on your windows, feel the wind howling. Don’t feel guilty. Again, it’s your choice, to let your dreams rot outside. As if you didnt’ love them, so, you know. To get true happiness you can only risk to be torn apart, slaughtered by this life. I get you don’t want to. As if living was everything.


You look behind, to that door you nailed with logs, ropes, locks, to make sure it stays shut. You shiver, cold sweat rolling down your spine. As if you weren’t sick, feverish. As if someone could ask you to come inside.
Dream.
Nobody is going to.
Nobody will insist.


You know, it’s like when you realize that you really want to solve your own issues. I mean, once all tha shit is cleaned up, once all those notes will be ashes, what will be left of you? You always knew it, you always got scared by ghosts. So you ended up living with them. As if feeling something was important.


You try to smile at your reflection, a barebones copy of your former self. And you remember, somebody once told you. That we all, everybody, we just smile with a gun to our head. Without knowing what we truly want, we end up with a bunch of shit we don’t care about. As if, having something was the point.


As if you weren’t your own worst enemy. Precluding yourself of every possible risk, oh, my queen. Outside is pouring cats and dogs, but your castle inside is burning to the ground. You were so naive. Thinking that any reality could satisfy you. You stupid, leaving your dreams freeze to death. 


Again, as if living was everything.

I know what it means to only have
leaves, grass, concrete, cardboard to sleep on


I am afraid of the roads at night
and I know what it’s like
to look straight into headlights
wondering what’s behind them
wondering if they’ll hit you


I know what it means to be thirsty, hungry


I know what it’s like not to have 
any place 
to call home


as I am,
and always will be

Panic
It just went away
As it came and
Nobody saw me
Nobody heard me


I am clinging to my guilt now
I will never settle
I sought, I seek
I always will seek


Nobody will stop me
Nobody will see me
Nobody will hear me
And again, 


It will just go away

Thorns
Thorns climbing my arm
As we cuddle, shy
Thorns surrounding this hug
Sweet and painful as only love can be
A life of needles keeping us apart
As if we were born of pain


Thorns in my lungs
As I kiss you
Blood trickling from our lips


Night, interior
We play, panting, rubbing
Licking our wounds
Sucking our fears
Wrapping our hearts with 
Barbed wire


Miracles don’t exist
It’s just us, carrying them out
Making of our thorns
A crown

Fall
It’s so beautiful
To fall, alone
Nobody waiting for me
It’s amazing,
To wake up
With nobody by my side
So much that I could go
Crazy

Vertigo ✅
Feet dangling over
An empty, black void
Back turned against
Darkness
With each swing
A glimpse of the abyss

Sooner or later, everybody does it. We spend our days packing, passively. 
________________
Rise ✅
I'm freezing,
ankle-deep in the cold sea waves.
Walking,
I watch the sun setting,
surrendering to the night.


It's taking forever,
like you.


I just seek my reckoning.
I am fire, I rise in flames,
even if it's cold, even if it's
dark.
I burn through everyone,
leaving only ashes behind.


Never looking back,
because I’m a liar and
a thief.


I just fake
being like everyone else,
while I steal your words,
your love, your trust,
your dreams,


away.


It's just that I'm tired, tired
of hearing people talking,
while saying nothing.


I am just waiting for the next
tragedy.
The next chance to scream,
to step heavy on the gas,
to punch someone in the face.


To kiss that beauty.


The next chance
to cry, and to
finally feel something.


The next chance,
to tell that lie.


The next excuse for writing bad poetry, for
sending sad texts.


To rip my heart apart
and build a new, better one.


I am alone, but I share your tears.
Now, I am your fears and dreams.
We are one, for a brief moment.
Freezing, while
scorched by our inner flame.
Walking into an endless sunset,
between madness and


sadness.
________________
Pieces ✅
Can’t face me whole
So tear me apart

Sorry ✅
After we met

After you got a glimpse
of what I went through


You told me
you felt sorry
you couldn’t be there 
when I was hurting
‘cause you didn’t know


Then,
when you knew,
you left
________________
Shadow
There’s a shadow
That’s been walking by your side
Since forever
Unknown
Ghastly.


This shadow knows.


It stinks of tears, and
masturbation,
blood, and
Fists clenched tight.


This shadow knows,
You.


You showed her everything,
Everything you couldn’t show
Us.


As if,
You could’ve hide from her.


Invisible,
Unattainable,
Queen of corpses and ghosts.


You can’t see her,
She can’t touch you but
She can hear you,
She can find you.


You belong to her.


Turn off the lights,
Bring her with you.


Ears ringing,
She’s right behind you.


It’s the fading silhouette of a whisper
In the dying darkness of your wake.


It’s a black shiver that runs down your spine.


This shadow knows,
Knows who you are when nobody is watching.
________________
Stumble
I stand at the edge of a cliff.
Below, a sea of dreams and hopes. The future I worked so hard for. 
Behind me, a darkness made of hardship and forgotten tragedies. I can still hear the painful sound of my knees scraping on concrete. Of my punches, thrown at the wall.


I take a few steps back, and I can feel the shadows trying to hug me, shivering down my spine. But I don’t look, my eyes set on the waves down below.
I’m young, ambitious.
I know only winners are allowed to live this cruel, merciless world.
And if you want to win others, you first need to win yourself.


Another step back. One more. Behind me, I can hear the stygian cloud screaming, begging for me to turn back.
But I have wings, made of paper, blood and ink.
I made a bet, on myself, and it’s looking a lot like throwing myself off that cliff.
I run, I catch speed, I didn’t even know I could run this fast.


As if I was at gunpoint.


And, as I prepare to jump,
finally,
I stumble.
________________
Calm
I will be calm, before the storm.
I will be sitting in the dark, sharpening an axe.
Sparks that light up my eyes, blind.
Useless, like your shield.
Like your smell.


I will be sitting by a corner, trying to understand how to put my soul on a slip of paper.
Silently, like your naked steps in the snow.
I’ll be there, when you’ll leave.
I’ll take the fall, carelessly.
I’ll break that shell you thought you could be.
I’ll dismantle that wall you thought you could have.


Sharp edges.
Ready to fight.
Ready to break my limits.
Hunter, prey.


With all those slips of paper, I had to make wings.
Because, I’ll be flying so high that I’ll almost, almost
fall.


I’ll be watching you, while you’ll be lost drowning in an ocean of sorrow.
You’ll be grasping for air, hopeless.
Faceless, lost in a dark pit with you guts full of pills.
I’ll spread my wings so high, so high that I’ll almost, almost
fall.


I’ll end up shining, supernova.
I’ll be your light in the dark.
I’ll be your lighthouse, so far up through the desperate sea.
I’ll be your calm,
before the storm.
________________
Cripple ✅
I can’t stand that look
I can’t stand the attention
like I was some sort of cripple

and what if I am not missing a leg
what if I am missing a brother
what if I’ve lost my mind

you’ll see me up there anyways
flying

________________


Shoot
I was born wrong, frustrated, antisocial.
I’m climbing my way up.
I am unbreakable. I will make mistakes, I will fall, and I will just get myself up.


I catch my breath.


I’m that voice you didn’t want to hear.
I’m your anxiety, slowly turning into horror.
I’m your prayers, your desire.


Shut it down,
shut yourself down,
shut yourself down
with me.


I’m just a meatbag, burning from the inside.
I’m rotting under the scorching sun.
Sometimes I dream, of being born
deaf, or blind.


You can try to bury me,
you’ll have to look at me rising back up.
Ink and fog, flames and tar,
feathers and ashes.
Always, you’ll see me spread my darkened wings.


Controversial,
compromised.


I’m the bullet inside a loaded gun.
I’m a caged beast breaking free.
I’m the spark at the bottom of the volcano.


Light it up,
light yourself up,
light yourself up
with me.


It’s just that I was born wrong, frustrated, antisocial.
I’m hitting rock bottom.
I feel fragile, I can’t make another mistake, I can’t make it up anymore.


I stop my breathing.
I’ve never been afraid of pulling that trigger.
________________


Shine
Each and everybody of us
has their own mountain to climb.
Everybody has that dream.
But somebody is actually chasing it.
Backpacking through hardship,
starving off failures,
empty pockets and
mind overflowing with
ambition.


Holding their head high,
looking up to the stars.


We all know, deep down,
that we can do it.
We can reach that peak.
But somebody is actually
grazing their knees,
flaying their fists,
burning their muscles.
Without care.
These people are actually
piles of scars and a collection of
falls and failures.
So many as
the times they got back up.


Holding their head high,
looking up to the stars.


They keep on going,
they face thorns and hunger,
rocks and thirst.
They climb mirrors,
jump off cliffs,
they just fucking fly.


Until.
A misstep.
A stumble, into darkness.
Too high to fall gracefully.
Into the void, fear, horror.


Holding their heads high, 
one final look at the stars, 
among which they now shine too.
