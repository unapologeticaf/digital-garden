Once upon a time, there was a kid who walked and walked a lot.

Walking and walking, one day the kid met a man. There was something strange about the man, so the kid asked:

*"Why don't you have the mouth?"*

*"Because in a world where everybody is already talking, whispering, and screaming,"* the man scribbled on a scrap of paper *"my words don't really matter and nobody would hear them anyway."*

After thinking about it, the kid took off his mouth and dropped it on the ground. He was about to ask another question to the man, but he was long gone.

The kid resumed his walk.

Walking and walking, one day the kid met another man. There was something strange about the man, so the kid scribbled down:

*"Why don't you have the ears?"*

*"Because in a world where nobody pays attention to anything but himself, where nobody is listening anymore"* the man replied, slowly *"I don't have anything meaningful to listen to, and even if I did I wouldn't care."*

After thinking about it, the kid took off his ears, one by one, and dropped them on the ground. He was about to ask another question to the man, but he was long gone.

The kid resumed his walk, again.

Walking and walking, one day the kid met a girl. There was something beautiful about the girl, and the kid stopped, breathless. But there was also something strange about the girl, so the kid started wondering how to ask her why.

Why she had no eyes.

No matter how hard he thought about it, the kid couldn't figure it out.

So he moved on.

Walking and walking, one day the kid found a city.

Everyone there had eyes, ears, and mouth. Everyone had nice clothes. Something to do. Something to say, something to listen to.

The deaf, mute, naked kid from outside had nothing.

The kid started to think he had made a mistake. It was too late to turn back, so the kid decided to hide. Nobody noticed.

Ashamed, the kid started building himself a mask. So as to cover up his mistakes. He wrapped himself in guilt, and he was on the move again.

Everyone was still looking at him.
