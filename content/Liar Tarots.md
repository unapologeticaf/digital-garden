as I was doing a daily drawing challenge for my [[stray.scribbles on Instagram|Instagram page]] I ended up recalling [[Liar's story (comic)|the story of my OC Liar]]. I always had a fascination for tarot cards and I always failed to create my own deck.. one thing carried the other and I made one for [[Liar]]
